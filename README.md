## Project Description

In today's fast-paced world, managing emotional well-being can be challenging. MoodMate addresses this by providing a frictionless way to log your mood, thoughts, and feelings in under 30 seconds. The application offers instant, AI-generated micro-feedback to provide empathetic support and help you understand your emotional patterns over time.

This project is currently in the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage, focusing on delivering a core, stable, and valuable experience around the "fast entry" feature.

## Getting Started Locally

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version `22.14.0`. It is recommended to use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
  ```sh
  nvm use
  ```

The following scripts are available in the `package.json`:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for errors.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Lints the codebase and automatically fixes issues.
